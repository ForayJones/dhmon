dhmon
=====

Awesome monitoring system for Dreamhack


Troubleshooting
====

1. NTP
When debugging dhmon, always make sure that time is set correctly.
Weird stuff will happen (data will not appear, inserts will be ignored etc.)
if you do not have the correct time set up.

2. Crashes
Blabalbal. Talk about crashes in launcher, dhmon et al.
status should work on a lot of daemons, but not launcher

3. Network rules
